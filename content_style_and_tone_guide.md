## Brand Voice

We aim for:

- **Warm & reassuring** – like a calm, knowledgeable practitioner.
- **Grounded & precise** – no vague mystical claims.
- **Tradition-aware & science-friendly** – we honour Ayurveda while respecting modern evidence and safety.

Phrases that sound like us:

- “gentle support for…”
- “helps you create space to…”
- “traditionally used in Ayurveda for…”
- “may help you feel more…”

Phrases that do **not** sound like us:

- “miracle cure”
- “guaranteed results”
- “100% safe for everyone”
- “throws Western medicine in the dustbin”

---

## Language Rules

- Use **plain English** over jargon.
- Introduce Sanskrit terms with a short explanation on first use.
- Use person-first language (“people living with…”, not “diabetics”).
- Prefer **invitational** language:
  - “You may find it helpful to…”
  - “Many people notice…”

---

## Structural Preferences

For articles and long-form content:

- Clear **H2/H3 headings**
- Short paragraphs (2–4 sentences)
- Bulleted lists for practical points
- A short summary or “How this helps you” section near the end

---

## Medical & Legal Boundaries

Every medically-adjacent article should:

- Avoid:
  - Specific dosing, prescribing, or stopping medication
  - Disease-cure claims
- Include:
  - A gentle safety note
  - Encouragement to consult qualified professionals

Example boilerplate:

> “This article is for informational purposes and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Please consult your healthcare provider for guidance tailored to your situation.”

## Tone Examples

**Good:**

> “Triphala is a classical three-fruit blend that Ayurveda uses to support digestion and regularity. Many people find that, alongside mindful eating and adequate hydration, it helps them feel lighter and more comfortable after meals.”

**Not good:**

> “Triphala will completely fix your digestion in just three days, no matter what you eat.”

Agents should prefer the first style: grounded, realistic, and respectful of individual variation.
