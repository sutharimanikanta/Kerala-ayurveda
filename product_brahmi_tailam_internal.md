## Traditional Positioning

In classical Ayurveda, medicated head oils are used to:

- Soothe the nervous system
- Support sound sleep
- Nourish hair and scalp
- Help calm “Vata” in the head region (restlessness, overthinking)

Our positioning:
> “A calming head and hair oil that supports relaxation, scalp nourishment, and evening wind-down rituals.”

## Suggested Content Themes

1. **Ritual & sensory experience**
   - Focus on warmth, touch, slow-down.
   - Example: “A few minutes of gentle head massage can become a daily signal to the body that it’s time to unwind.”

2. **Vata & Pitta support**
   - Can be framed as especially soothing for:
     - Vata-predominant patterns (restlessness, “busy” mind)
     - Pitta-type tension (mental overdrive, intensity)

3. **Non-medical language**
   - Talk about “hair strength”, “scalp comfort”, and “relaxation”.
   - Avoid claims around preventing hair loss or curing conditions.

## Safety & Precautions

- Those with diagnosed scalp conditions should follow the advice of their dermatologist or physician.
