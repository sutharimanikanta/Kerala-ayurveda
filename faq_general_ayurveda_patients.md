# FAQ – General Ayurveda Questions (Public-Facing Draft)

This FAQ is a useful grounding document for Q&A and RAG responses.

## 1. Is Ayurveda safe to combine with modern medicine?

Ayurveda is often used alongside modern medicine. However, herb–drug interactions are possible, and individual health situations vary.

We encourage readers to:
- Inform their doctor about any Ayurvedic supplements or therapies they use.
- Consult both their Ayurvedic practitioner and medical doctor if they have chronic conditions or take prescription medicines.

We do not advise stopping or changing medication without medical supervision.

## 2. How long does it take to see results?

Timelines vary from person to person. In general:

- Some people may feel changes in sleep, digestion, or energy in a few weeks.
- Deeper changes in patterns (stress, lifestyle, long-standing discomforts) often take longer.

We recommend thinking in terms of **weeks to months**, not overnight fixes.

## 3. Can Ayurveda help with stress and sleep?

Ayurveda approaches stress and sleep through:

- Daily routines (like consistent sleep–wake timing)
- Food choices that feel grounding
- Herbs like Ashwagandha, traditionally used to support the body’s stress response
- Therapies such as oil massages and head oil applications

Ayurvedic support can complement, but not replace, professional mental health care when needed.

## 4. Are Ayurvedic herbs natural and side-effect free?

“Natural” does not automatically mean safe for everyone.

Points we emphasise:
- Herbs are **active substances** and may not suit every person.
- Quality and sourcing matter.
- Dose, duration, and context should be personalised.

People with chronic illnesses, pregnant or nursing individuals, and those on medication should consult a healthcare provider before starting herbs.

## 5. Do I need to know my dosha before starting?

Knowing your dosha can be interesting and helpful, but it is not mandatory.

For many people, simple foundational actions – better sleep hygiene, mindful eating, gentle movement, stress management – make a meaningful difference, even before deep dosha analysis.

Our content should keep Ayurveda accessible and not gatekeep wellbeing behind complex concepts.
