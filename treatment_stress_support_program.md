_For internal use when describing clinic offerings and content themes._

## Core Components

1. **Initial Ayurvedic Consultation**
   - Detailed history of lifestyle, sleep, digestion, stressors.
   - Assessment of dosha tendencies and current imbalance.
   - Collaborative goal-setting (e.g., “improved quality of sleep”, “feeling less wired at the end of the workday”).

2. **Therapy Plan (Example)**
   - Abhyanga (traditional oil body massage) on selected days
   - Shirodhara (gentle stream of oil over the forehead) when indicated
   - Simple breathing and grounding practices taught in-clinic

3. **Home Routine Suggestions**
   - Simple, realistic suggestions aligned with the person’s context.
   - Evening wind-down ideas, regular mealtimes, screen boundaries, etc.
   - Use neutral language: invitations, not strict rules.

We do **not** prescribe or adjust psychiatric medication.
