## Traditional Positioning

In Ayurveda, Triphala is traditionally used to support:

- Digestive comfort
- Regular elimination
- Gentle internal cleansing
- Long-term vitality through “rasayana” (rejuvenation) actions

Our positioning:
> “A gentle daily support for digestion and regularity, rooted in a classical three-fruit formula.”

Avoid words like “detox” when they are vague. Prefer “supports the body’s natural cleansing processes”.
