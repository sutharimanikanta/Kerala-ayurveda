# Ayurveda Foundations – Internal Primer

_Last updated: Oct 2025_

## What is Ayurveda?

Ayurveda is a traditional system of health that originated in India. It focuses on:

- Understanding an individual's constitution (*prakriti*)
- Maintaining balance between body, mind, and environment
- Using diet, lifestyle, herbs, and therapies to support wellbeing

In our content, we describe Ayurveda as:

> "A traditional, holistic system that supports balance and resilience – not a quick-fix or miracle cure."

Avoid language that promises guaranteed results or cures.

## The Tridosha Model (Vata, Pitta, Kapha)

Ayurveda groups functions of the body–mind into three broad principles called *doshas*:

- **Vata** – associated with movement, communication, adaptability
- **Pitta** – associated with transformation, digestion, metabolism, focus
- **Kapha** – associated with stability, structure, nourishment, lubrication

Every person has all three, in unique proportions. Imbalance can show up as discomfort in energy, digestion, sleep, mood, or other functions.

In content:
- Emphasise “tendencies” and “patterns”, not rigid labels.
- Avoid statements like “Vata people must never eat X”.

## How we position Ayurveda at Kerala Ayurveda

For Kerala Ayurveda content:

- We focus on **supporting** natural processes (digestion, sleep, joint comfort, stress resilience).
- We do **not** claim to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent diseases.
- We encourage readers to work with qualified practitioners, especially if they:
  - Are pregnant or nursing
  - Have a chronic medical condition
  - Take prescription medication

Preferred phrasing:
- “Traditionally used to support…”
- “May help maintain…”
- “Is commonly used in Ayurveda for…”

Avoid:
- “Cures arthritis”
- “Guaranteed fat loss”
- “Scientifically proven miracle remedy”

## Kerala Ayurveda Content Boundaries (for writers & agents)

- No specific dosing instructions (“take 2 tablets twice daily”) in public-facing content.
- No suggesting stopping or changing prescribed medication.
- Always add a gentle safety note for herbs and therapies:

  > “Individuals with existing medical conditions or those on medication should consult their healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or therapy.”

This document is a **primary grounding reference** for brand-safe medical language.
