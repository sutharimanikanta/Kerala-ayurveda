## How agents should use this

When generating content:

- Use these patterns as **flavour**, not one-size-fits-all prescriptions.
- Give examples like:
  - “A Vata-dominant person may benefit from…”
  - “Kapha constitutions often respond well to steady, consistent movement.”

Never hard-code individual recommendations; keep it educational and exploratory.
